      description: "Tai Ping Hou Kui literally means 'peaceful monkey leader' and is grown at the foothill of Huangshan in the Anhui province. Its breathtaking elegantly long emerald leaves are hand-pressed, bringing forth a dry aroma of un-roasted chestnuts and light fruitiness. The liquor is light-bodied and delicate with nuances of nut, a touch of sweet grass, lily-of -the valley floral, and a whispery apricot note. The delicate floral and apricot notes linger nicely on the palate.",

Its dry aroma is that of hops and white grape, while the liquor is sweet, pear-like, crisp and lingering. The long small wiry leaves of this Meng Ding Mao Feng are very tightly rolled. When brewed they unfurl, allowing you to see the small buds and leaves. Delicate and delicious!",

Once processed, Yun Wu tends to have characteristically irregular twisted leaves, however, it has also been seen rolled up into small pellets or spiral shapes. Its unique growing conditions yield a layered cup with fruity notes and a very light smokiness.",

Tightly rolled Anxi grown leaf with a light roasting offers a cup that is soft with sweet honey-floral notes and a delicate flinty minerality. Nicely layered without being too overt.",

Its name, which translates to Golden Peacock, is as flashy as its namesake with fairly large, very golden leaves and leaf buds.

The semi wiry leaves do contain some tips as well. The dry aroma offers the classic Keemun orchid note. The cup itself is a medium-light bodied one that is delicate, sweet and complex with notes of orchid, honey and toast.
