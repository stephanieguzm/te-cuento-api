I made it in my clear glass teapot and loved seeing the leaves expand as they steeped. I forgot about the tea in the pot and when i went back, the color was darker and the tea was more delicious."

At 3 minutes, there is absolutely no bitterness (I think I prefer 2 minutes, it is a perfect, delicate, pale green elixir). I was afraid to try it because I don't like smoky flavored tea at all. But I am getting zero smoke flavor. It's nutty, buttery, green, and fabulous!"

It has become my early morning gongfu favorite, starting at 15 seconds and increasing by the same for each additional steep. It also works well Western style for those hectic days."

When steeped, they open up and render a pale yellow liquor with a clean, delicate, mildly sweet flavor that holds up to multiple steeps and is perfect for gong fu brewing. Sip, sip away!"

The yellow tea process brings out the flavor of the leaf without grassiness. This one is best brewed gongfu style and has a subtle floral finish. "

Though, I d recommend it only to people who appreciate soft and subtle flavors, as if you don't like that sort of thing, you may just consider it 'weak'."

I accidentally steeped it longer than I usually do, and there was barely any astringency. The leaves are large, golden, and toasty. The scent is malty and enticing. Forefront in the taste I get malt and honey. Not getting any cocoa, and I'm not sure what sweet potato tastes like (haven't eaten in in forever) but that in the description grabbed me. I really, really like this tea; it's like a warm hug for my soul. :)"

You will undoubtedly taste the toastiness and the sweet potato from the get go, but let it sit a minute or two and you will taste the fullness of the honey and cocoa. A true tea drinkers delight!"

I really enjoyed this tea, it was the best of green and puerh tea. Mellow like a puerh if steeped at a lower temperature and shorter duration. It has a bit of a green tea astringency the longer it is steeped. Delicious western style and much more layered and complex gongfu style."

The floral and straw notes are prominent, but the subtle notes of sweetness create a well-balanced, rounded cup. This tea is ideally suited to lingering over on a cool, grey day. I love silver needle white tea, and this is an outstanding example of silver needle."

A fragrant mouthfeel and long-lasting lingering sweet aftertaste was noted. This was an excellent example of a gentle, smooth and light tasting Silver Needle white tea. A second steep for 2.5 minutes was even better in tastes, A pleasant astringency was noted on the rear inside of the cheeks, just like a fine nice white wine."
